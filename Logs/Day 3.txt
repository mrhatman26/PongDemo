Day 3 Notes (07.01.24):
-15:56: Continuing (and maybe finishing? :O) the pong demo...
-17:04: After a lot of messing around with changing x and y coodinates and then rerunning to check if an object
is where I want it to be, getting the font for Pong and mathematics in Photoshop, I have finally added the drawing
of both players' scores. The scores still do not change however. I am quite surprised it took me an hour to implement this...:
	-Updated "PongDemon.java". (Now disposes some Gdx objects I forgot to dispose)
	-Updated "Batton.java".
-17:16: Both players' scores now change depending on which side of the screen the ball goes off.
If the ball goes off the left side of the screen, the right player gets their score increase by one and vice versa.
-17:25: The ball now pauses breifly when it is reset just like in actual Pong.
	-Updated "Ball.java".
-17:32: If the score for either player is in double digits, the score is drawn a bit more to the left as it looks weird otherwise.
The players' scores can also only go up to 99. After this, the game will automatically set the score back to 99 if the score goes above 99.
	-Updated "Batton.java".
With that, I personally consider this to be done. At a later stage I may add more stuff, but for now, I'm keeping it simple. (As for the bugs...
Yeah, they exist...)
Bye bye.
