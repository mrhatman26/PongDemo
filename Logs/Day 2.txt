Day 2 Notes (06.01.24):
-13:30: Continuing Pong Demo...
Trying to figure out why my bounce code is getting the ball to be stuck sometimes...
-13:57: Hold on, one of my old games in GameMaker has bounce code. Maybe that might help?
-14:54: No progress made on the bouncing. GameMaker did not help.
I found a bit of code though that goes "direction = direction * -1;" which supposedly flips the direction.
The problem I am having is that the direction DOES get flipped, but it flips back immediately and so
the ball just keeps going in the original direction while vibrating. Not sure how I am going to fix this at all.
-15:06: Taking a break for a bit. Maybe a break will help me think of the sollution? (Hint: No it won't, it'll make me think of
stupid sollutions that don't work in the slightest. The answer is probably really, really simple and I'm just too brain dead to think
of it)
-15:15: Looks like it was much worse. My direction code is stupid. Direction does affect movement, but an increase of only a few
decimals is enough to do a 360 degree turn. Also, 0 degrees is up not right. -_-
Not sure how I'll fix this at all. Also yes, I lied about having a break.
15:36: Odd, turns out direction barely matters at all? Apart from setting the ball off of course.
If I convert the speed to speedX and speedY, I can flip one of each to bounce. (By flip, I mean switch between negative and positive)
So, if the ball bounces on the y axis, I flip speedY. If the ball bounces on the x axis, I flip speedX instead. Both the screen bounce and the batton bounce solved in
one. It does have problems though. I've seen the ball slide across the bottom at least once with this:
	-Updated "Ball.java". (Needs cleanup!)
	-Updated "PongDemo.java". (Needs cleanup!)
-15:43: I forgot to mention that one problem I am having is that I cannot check ahead of an object along one axis. I can only use this "overlaps" method.
I say this is a problem because I cannot check if the ball is colliding with the top or the bottom. Just the sides. And so, the ball will go through if this happens.
I may have founda sollution on StackOverFlow using the alternate "Intersection" class, but I have not tried it yet as I only found it while typing this.
-16:38: The ball now plays sounds when it bounces or when it goes off the screen. This took me so long to implement because I needed to cut the sounds I found
into individual files. (The sounds I found were from freesound.org from the original Pong. URL is: freesound.org/people/mickdow/sounds/177409/)
Next thing to implement is the scores. The battons already have score variables, but they stay at 0. However, I will take an actual break now.
-16:45: I couldn't help myself to do some more changes. I made it so that the game can be restarted by holding either shift key and R.
	-Updated "PlayerControls.java".
