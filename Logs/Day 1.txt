Day 1 Notes (05.01.24):
-Started Pong demo using Java and libGDX.
-14:26: Modified "DesktopLauncher.java" to:
	-Give the game the title of "PongDemo".
	-Make the game windowed with a resolution of 1280x720.
	-Use vsync. (Bad for bigger games, but okay for smaller ones)
-14:49: After some annoyance loading an old pong demo I made in Game Maker, I made two
sprites for the battons and the ball using the sprites in that old demo for size reference.
I made the sprites in GraphicsGale:
	-Created "spr_batton.png".
	-Created "spr_ball.png".
	-Saved both files to the assets folder of the PongDemo project.
-15:30: Created two new classes. One called "Batton" which will be the two battons used by the player(s).
The other class is "PlayerControls" which will handle the up and down controls of the player:
	-Created "Batton.java" which handles the player battons.
	-Created "PlayerControls.java" which handles the controls of the Battons.
-15:56: Added the creation and updating/drawing of the battons to the main class.
The up and down controls were the wrong way round so I swapped them.
Also added the ability to close and exit the game by pressing the escape key.
	-Updated "PongDemon.java".
	-Updated "Batton.java".
	-Updated "PlayerControls.java".
-16:05: Updated the player controls to be seperate for both battons.
I forgot to do this so both were moving at the same time. I am an idiot:
	-Updated "PlayerControls.java". Modified "checkControls" (Now accepts new argument "isSecondPlayer")
-16:10: Updated the batton class to check if the batton is outside the screen and to stop if it is.
	-Updated "Batton.java". Modified "update".
-16:16: Updated player controls to move the battons faster. (Increased movement interger to 400 and created a final variable
called MOVE_SPEED to represent it)
	-Updated "PlayerControls.java".
-16:42: Created new class called "Ball". This will act as the ball.
However, one problem is that I am not good at maths and so I do not know how
to give the ball a direction. As in, I do not know how to get the ball to move
forward 45 degrees apart from manually doing it with the X and Y variables... :(
Got to keep looking...:
	-Created "Ball.java".
-17:32: Updated ball class to move and... USE DIRECTION!
I don't know what sin and cos do because I'm awful, terrible at maths, but they work!
Also made it so that ball returns to centre of screen when it goes off the screen.
Also, a new ball can be spawned by pressing the enter key.
	-Updated "Ball.java".
	-Updated "PlayerControls.java". (Temporary controls to be removed (Temporary controls allow balls direction to be changed with the left and right arrow keys)
	-Updated "PongDemo.java".
-20:01: Balls now bounce when they hit a batton.
	-Updated "PongDemo.java".
	-Updated "Batton.java".
	-Updated "Ball.java".
-20:19: Balls can now be removed by pressing H.
However, this does not follow the tutorial's approach of removing the balls one by one and
I instead set the entire array of balls to be null. Probably a bad approach, but the tutorial way
seemingly did nothing????
	-Updated "PongDemon.java"
